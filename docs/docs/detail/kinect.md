# Kinect
## USB Conversion
The Xbox 360 kinect operates at:
* Voltage: 12V 
* Maximum power: 12W (1A)

To use this with the battery running 7.4V the voltage needs to be stepped up. I used a "Mini Voltage Converter Step-Up Module" from [magic-stone-us](https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/magic-stone-us?_trksid=p2047675.l2563) on eBay.  


## ROS library
