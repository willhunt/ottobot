# About Me
I am transitioning into the career of robotics engineer after studying Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London and then working as a Mechanical and Design Engineer at Dyson for over 8 years. Since leaving Dyson I have been self studying robotics using modern online learning platforms such as edX and Udacity after becoming familiar with them over the last several years whilst learning programming.
