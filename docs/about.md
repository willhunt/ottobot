# The Project
This project is a realistion of the [simulated projects](https://github.com/willhunt/robo_nd_project5) completed out on courses such as the Udacity [Robotics Software Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209). The mobile robot will be running on ROS and will be replicated both in gazebo and as a physical machine. The intention is to test teloperation as well as intelligent navigation through the ROS navigation stack and then onto test more advanced self coded projects including control systems.

# Me
I am transitioning into the career of robotics engineer after studying Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London and then working as a Mechanical and Design Engineer at Dyson for over 8 years. Since leaving Dyson I have been self studying robotics using modern online learning platforms such as edX and Udacity after becoming familiar with them over the last several years whilst learning programming.
